/instructions/

Each edge between nodes has a corresponding directory that stores the markdown and images for its navigation instructions.

Directories are named after the `navID` values of the corresponding nodes, and directions are direction-specific (i.e. instructions are written for both `t1a-t1b` and `t1b-t1a`)
